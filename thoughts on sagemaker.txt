Model training allows fairly fine grained control.

It can take several minutes from launching your training job until the actual training starts. Take a while to discover any mistakes made.
Using notebooks with an active gpu instance is probably better, at the very least in the development phase. 
Training jobs still have a lot of the nitty gritty details, at least for image classification, so might as well go all the way
